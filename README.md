##Data Analysis Challenge: "What Influences Students' Academic Performance?"

### - Context:
As part of a data science team, my colleagues and I were tasked with analyzing university data to identify the key factors that most significantly impact students' final exam performance. Using datasets on student demographics, habits, and academic records, we extracted actionable insights to help the institution design targeted support policies for its students.

### - Objective:
Explore variables like study time, attendance, socioeconomic background, and more to uncover patterns. The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations to improve student outcomes.
